        <p>
            I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br>
            Are you - Nobody - Too?<br>
            Then there's a pair of us!<br>
            Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!
        </p>
        <!-- Stanza 2 -->        
        <p>
            How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br>
            How public - like a Frog -<br>
            To tell one's name - the livelong June -<br>
            To an admiring Bod!
            <br>
